# Buoy-Detection

Buoy detection is implemented in 3 stages:

    1. By Using 1D Gaussian.
    2. BY Using 3 1D Gaussian, each for a single colored Buoy.
    3. Use of Expection-Maximation Algorithm for improving the search results. 
       ( Still needs to be worked on)

The output video frame looks like as follows:
